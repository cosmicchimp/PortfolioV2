<div class="biohead"><h3>Hi, I'm Max! A UNM Student.</h3></div>
<div><p id="biop">I moved to Albuquerque from North Carolina. And I'm currently enrolled at UNM majoring in business with a marketing focus. 
    Some of my hobbies are skating, wrestling, really I just enjoy exercise in general. Recently I have begun to have an interest in web development and coding as a whole.
    This website is a product of that curiousity, over the course of my learning journey I will be adding more and more to this webpage. I hope that over a short period of time
    I will be more proficient within CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Which will then allow me to significantly improve the layout and appearance of this website. Let's see how it goes.</p></div>
